-------------------------------------

Purpose
----------

This script called `run_analysis.R` does the following

1. Install and loads the require packages for analysis
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts Only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activites in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
6. From the data set in step 5, the script creates a second and independent tidy data set with averag   e of each variable for each activity and each subject.

*This R code produces a file called `tidy_data.txt`which is a single final data set*
